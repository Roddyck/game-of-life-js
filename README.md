# Conway's Game of Life

Simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in JavaScript.

Can run in the browser (see [index.html](index.html)) or in Node.js (see [index.js](index.js)).

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## TODO

- [x] Basic implementation for browser
- [x] Basic implementation for Node.js
- [ ] Add configuration (json or/and inputs from the page)
- [ ] Presets (e.g. glider, spaceship)
- [ ] Keyboard controls in the browser (start/stop, clear, randomize)
- [ ] Enhance node implementation. At least redraw the board instead of just drawing the next generation.
- [ ] Some styling (dark mode would be nice)
- [ ] Testing ???
